💻 Operating System Lab(SWE-234)

Welcome to the Operating-System-Lab repository!
This repository showcases practical implementations of core Operating System concepts using C programming and Shell scripting, aimed at strengthening and understanding of OS mechanisms like CPU scheduling, process management, multithreading, file operations and more!:D
